These scripts can be used to optimize the propeller and airframe geometry considering the aerodynamic performance for certain flight conditions. 
Current flight conditions evaluated are cruise at 300km/h-1000m and hover at 0m. 
Optimization scheme, airframe geometry and aerodynamic model are presented in the correspondent images. Propeller performance is obtained with QPROP.
mat files included some of the results obtained. Data may not be clean, including several variables not necessary within the optimization.
