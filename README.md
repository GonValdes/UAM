Urban Air Mobility IRP Thesis

Part of the IRP of the MSc in Aerospace Dynamics at Cranfield University. Code written in MATLABv2019b, Simulink and Simscape.
Includes some of the files necessary to run AVL, QPROP and the optimization procedure among many others. Additional scripts can be provided by the author. 

AVL folder includes the documentation needed to run AVL alone and can be used for any aircraft design within the limits of vortex lattice method. Optimization folder includes the assembly of the model for optimization, including propellers and corrections. 
Model of the full aircraft does not include battery as it was not necessary for implementation in the flight simulator. Powerplant with battery model can be found in a different model.

Code is based on the thesis, provided as a documentation. In case of any doubt or further enquiries, please contact at gonzalovaldescernuda@gmail.com
